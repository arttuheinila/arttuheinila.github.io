                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I started learning to code with Python out of curiosity in 2019. After learning the basics I enrolled in Data Sciences program in Codecademy. After the Data Sciences -path I continued learning coding with bunch of different coding books and crafting personal projects that seemed fun.</p>
                        <p>I love the challenge, constant learning and feeling of control of programming. I got interested in working as a programmer and enrolled in Full Stack Engineer career path in Codecademy. My certificate can be viewed <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/arttu_heinila/certificates/ffd0f42cce1a44e9a0108b365047a0a6">here</a></a></p>
                        <p>I also have a Master's Degree in Social Services and am working in that field. Social services background gives me a unique set of skills and experiences that might prove helpful as a programmer working on different projects.</p>
                        <p>Fun fact! I have been programming for <span id="time-container">NaN</span> seconds!</p>
                        <p>My GitHub repo is <a href="https://github.com/arttuheinila/">here</a></p>
